Hi! Im a Data Scientist based in São Paulo, Brazil.

In 2016 I made a radical change in my life and career. I decided I wanted to get into tech and become a Data Scientist. 

I had a lot of things to cover: programming, linear algebra, probability, and statistics. It was a lot, but It didn’t feel like work. I was hooked. I just loved the combination of math and programming. And I found out it suited well to my engineering background.

After one year of rigorous self-study, I got offered a job as Data Scientist at a leading analytics startup in Brazil.

### My goals for 2018:
- Make 5 contributions to Pandas and Scikit-learn
- Finish top 5% in a Kaggle competition
