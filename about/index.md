Hi! Im a Data Scientist based in São Paulo, Brazil.

In 2016 I made a radical change in my life and career. I decided I wanted to get into tech and become a Data Scientist. 

I had a lot of things to cover: programming, linear algebra, probability, and statistics. It was a lot, but It didn’t feel like work. I was hooked. I just loved the combination of math and programming. And I found out it suited well to my engineering background. After one year of rigorous self-study, I got offered a job as Data Scientist at a leading analytics startup in Brazil.

Currently, I work for a startup based off Palo Alto. We created a product that optimizes the cooling energy efficiency of data centers. It's alreadt being used by the two of the largest colocation providers in the world!
